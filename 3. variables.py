#Store the principal amount, rate of interest, and time indifferent variables and then calculate the Simple Interest for 3 years. Formula: Simple Interest = P x R x T / 100
P = 5000.  #principal amount
R = 5.     #Rate of intrest
T = 3.     # Time in years

SI = (P*R*T)/100
print("Simple Intrest =",SI)
